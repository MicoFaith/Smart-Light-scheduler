# üåü SmartLight Scheduler

A creative IoT dashboard that allows users to schedule ON and OFF times for a light‚Äîsimulating a smart home lighting system using **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, **WebSocket**, **MQTT**, and **Arduino**.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Simulate a real-world IoT dashboard to control a light through an intuitive interface and robust communication pipeline:

- **Frontend**: Clean and responsive UI for scheduling ON/OFF times.
- **WebSocket Server (Python)**: Receives schedule and publishes to MQTT broker.
- **MQTT Subscriber (Python)**: Listens to schedule updates and sends serial commands to Arduino.
- **Arduino**: Reads serial input and toggles a relay based on `1` (ON) or `0` (OFF).
